- An *Ignition* is a type of move that makes someone blind-play a card from their *Finesse Position*.
- An *Ignition* is different from a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* because the blind-play from an *Ignition* is:
  - unrelated to the clue that was given
    - e.g. It doesn't "match", which is unlike a *Finesse*, but like a *Bluff*.
  - unrelated to the *playability* of the clued card
    - e.g. Nothing needs to be "proved" to the player who got clued, which is unlike a *Finesse*, and unlike a *Bluff*.

### Trash Double Ignition (with Known Trash)

- Towards the end of the game, if a player clues known trash, then there are usually 2 possible interpretations:

#### 1) A Late-Game Trash Chop Move

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Chop Move* by cluing known trash in another player's hand (off-chop).
- However, players can know that *Trash Chop Move* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the *Chop Moved* card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no cards left to *Chop Move* (meaning that all of the cards are accounted for, or all of the remaining cards could be given a direct *Play Clue* or a direct *Save Clue*).

#### 2) A Late-Game *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*)

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*) by cluing known trash in another player's hand (on-chop).
- However, players can know that a *Trash Push* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the "pushed" card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no more cards left to *Trash Push*

#### A Trash Double Ignition

- If the known trash clue cannot be either of these 2 things, then it communicates a *Trash Double Ignition*, meaning that two players on the team need to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as any playable card.
- In most circumstances, a *Trash Double Ignition* should be clear. This is because the two players with a playable card will each see that the clue giver should have clued the other playable card directly (instead of touching trash).
- Sometimes, three players on the team will have playable cards on *Finesse Position*. If a *Trash Double Ignition* is performed in this case, similar to how an *Ambiguous Finesse* works, it will "get" the cards from the final two players. (Bob will do nothing because he sees that the *Trash Double Ignition* is on Cathy and Donald.)

#### Skipping Bluff Seat

- Rarely, if Bob has a playable card, a *Trash Double Ignition* can skip over Bob and affect Cathy and Donald.

#### Conflict with Bad Chop Move Ejection

- Technically, cluing a known trash card to *Chop Move* a "bad" card would trigger an *Ejection* (as a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection*).
- In this situation, players should always assume a *Trash Double Ignition* over a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection* (since the latter is very rare).

### Replay Double Ignition 

- If a player is not in a [stall situation](level_6.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) or [stalling for end-game purposes](level_6.md#burning-end-game-stalling), it would be very odd if they give a re-clue a globally known playable card.
- Indeed, if they are not making a mistake, such a choice must have some other meaning. We agree that the intended meaning of the clue is a *Replay Double Ignition*, meaning that two players should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card.
- A *Replay Double Ignition* may not pick up new cards.
- Unlike the *Trash Double Ignition*, the *Replay Double Ignition* may be performed outside of the *End-Game*.  
- Note that before the *End-Game*, there are often other clues that may be able to get the two cards played. It is ill-advised to attempt a *Replay Double Ignition* if there are other means of getting the cards played. For example, a direct finesse, a sequence of two bluffs, or a double bluff provides additional information and may pick up other good cards.

### Poke Double Ignition

- Similar to a *Replay Double Ignition*, if a player is not stalling, it would be very odd if they re-clue a card that is globally known as trash.
- Indeed, if they are not making a mistake, we agree that the intended meaning of the clue is a *Poke Double Ignition*, meaning that two players should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card.
- A *Poke Double Ignition* may not pick up new cards. 
- Like the *Replay Double Ignition*, the *Poke Double Ignition* may be performed outside of the *End-Game*. 
- In addition, it is not advised to perform the *Poke Double Ignition* if there are other means of getting the cards played that provide additional information.
